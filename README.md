Python application which displays current stats from Spotify, supposed to be used on a Raspberry Pi or similar devices.

It can display the Album Art, song progress, playstate (play-pause) of music and podcast.

It is supposed to be run on 800x480 screen resolution.

You can also add a button to the GPIO-Pins that pauses or resumes the playing.

Before using this, you need to install PyQt6 and all other requirements from the requirements.txt file.
